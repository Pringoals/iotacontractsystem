# iotacontractsystem
 A Peer to peer contract software based on IOTA implemented in Python 2.7 & PyQT4 

## About 

This system has been designed and implemented as a proof of concept where by two users can establish a consensus using Distrobuted Ledger Technology (DLT). The system incoporates traditonal methods of establishing contract by allowing documents to be uploaded to the Tangle and maintaining a legal standing. 

To make the system simple to use, A contract wizard has been implemeneted that allows users to generate contracts between each party while using Distrobuted ledger technology to send and record. 

## why IOTA?
 
IOTA was chosen as the DLT for this proof of concept (POC) as it provided better performannce over "traditonal" Blockchain based DLT's tihs decission was taken after reserch into a variaty of trusted DLT developable platforms. 

## Things left to implement 

- [ ] MAM end to end encrption 
- [ ] PyQt threading
