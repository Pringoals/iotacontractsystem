# iotacontractsystem
 A Peer to peer contract software based on IOTA implemented in Python 2.7 & PyQT4 

## About 

This system has been designed and implemented as a proof of concept (POC) where by two users can establish a consensus using Distrobuted Ledger Technology (DLT). The aim of this POC is to use DLT's to remove the need for solicitation when establishing buisness to buisness (B2B) or Buisness to Customer (B2C) contracts, Reducing cost and improving efficancy.

To make the system simple to use, A contract wizard has been implemeneted that allows users to generate contracts between each party while using Distrobuted ledger technology to send and record. The system incoporates traditonal methods of establishing contract by allowing documents to be uploaded to the Tangle and maintaining a legal standing. 


## Why IOTA?
 
IOTA was chosen as the DLT for this POC as it provided better performannce over "traditonal" Blockchain based DLT's tihs decission was taken after reserch into a variaty of trusted DLT developable platforms.
